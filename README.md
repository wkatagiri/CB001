These codes are written for fluorescence image analysis image analysis over different time points.
We used these codes to analyse T cells which sizes are around 10 Âµm, respectively. If you want to use the program for other cells, you may need to edit the code as accordingly.

First file, "No1_Functions", contains two functions. One recognizes centers of cells, and the other considers only cells that did not move over time as signal.
Second file, "No2_Function", contains two functions. One convert the location of the cells (coodinates of x-y Euclian Space) into irradiance which the cells experienced. The constant numbers for curve fitting are defined from independent experiments. Another is to sort the data based on two irradiance information.
Third file, "No3_Program", runs with previous two functions and analyze images and create summary xlsx file.
